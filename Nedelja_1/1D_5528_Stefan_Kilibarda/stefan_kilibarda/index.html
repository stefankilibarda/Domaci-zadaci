            <h4>Characteristics</h4>

        <div>
            Huskies are energetic and athletic.<br> They usually have a thick double coat that can be gray, black, copper red, or white.<br> The double coat generally protects huskies against harsh winters and, contrary to what most believe, they can survive in hotter climates.<br> During the hotter climates, huskies tend to shed their undercoat regularly to cool their bodies.<br> In addition to shedding, huskies control their eating habits based on the season; in cooler climates, they tend to eat generous amounts, causing their digestion to generate heat, whilst in warmer climates, they eat less.<br> Their eyes are typically pale blue, although they may also be brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic.<br> Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than most other breeds.<br> Hunting instincts can still be found in some of this breed today.
