                <p class="text_content21"><img src="foto1.jpg" alt="my dad and myself visiting a factory">I have been working on and off in my family trading company in the sales deparment. Usually my job consists of email correspondence with clients and our supliers around the globe. It also means traveling and visiting our partners, meeting new people and seeing a lot of interesting stuff.</p>
                <p class="text_content22"><img src="foto2.jpg" alt="science fair booth">While studying at the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education I took part in some extracurricular activities, volunteering in science fairs, a strength development research and other kinds of activities in representing my Faculty and gaining new knowledge. My favorite was a Science Fair in 2017 when we presented a motion analysis system.</p>
                <p class="text_content23"><img src="foto3.jpg" alt="skydiving">I like all kinds of activities, I like to try new things and continue with the ones that stick, I have tried skydiving, rock climbing, archery, I've practiced martial arts and kickboxing, I like hiking and generally being outdoors. I think everything is worth trying, even if it's a bit intimidating. I like photography and playing chess even though I'm not the very good at it, but I try to learn and become better. I took a course in Software Testing using Python, a long time ago I took a short course in basic photography, and my plan is to take a course in horseback riding. </p>
